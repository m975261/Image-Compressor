Build a secure web application with two tabs:
(A) Image Converter and (B) Temporary File Sharing.

The application must be production-ready, deterministic, and compliant with the constraints below.

A) Image Converter Tab
1. Purpose

Allow users to upload an animated GIF and convert it according to either:

Yalla Ludo preset, or

Custom (“Other”) settings

The animation must never break.

2. User Interface
A. Upload

Accept animated GIF only

Reject static images and non-GIF formats

Validate on both client and server

B. Mode Selection

Use radio buttons or mutually exclusive checkboxes:

Option 1: Yalla Ludo

No manual inputs visible

Fixed rules applied automatically

Option 2: Other (Custom)

Show input fields:

Maximum file size (MB)

Maximum width (px)

Maximum height (px)

C. Convert Button

Disabled until:

Valid GIF uploaded

Mode selected

Required custom inputs provided (if applicable)

D. Output

Animated preview

Final file size

Final width × height

Download button

3. Conversion Rules (CRITICAL)
General Rules (All Modes)

Animation must remain animated

Frame order preserved

No frame flattening

No freezing

No frame corruption

Transparency preserved if present

Aspect ratio preserved

No cropping

No stretching

Yalla Ludo Preset (Hard Limits)

Maximum file size: 2 MB

Maximum width: 180 px

Maximum height: 180 px

If limits are exceeded, apply optimization in this exact order:

Resize (maintain aspect ratio)

Palette optimization

Minimal frame-rate reduction

Trim animation duration from the END ONLY

If still above limits, return a clear error.

Custom Mode

User defines:

Max file size (MB)

Max width (px)

Max height (px)

Apply the same optimization order

Duration trimming only if required, and only from the end

4. Backend Requirements (Image Tab)

Node.js backend

Use reliable animation-safe tools such as:

gifsicle

or ffmpeg

Preserve loop behavior

Preserve animation timing as much as possible

B) Temporary File Sharing Tab
1. Purpose

Allow users to upload any file type and receive a temporary download link.

2. User Interface
A. Upload

Accept any file type

Display:

File name

File size

B. Expiry Selection

Default expiry: 24 hours

User may choose any shorter duration

User cannot exceed 24 hours

Allow manual early deletion (reduce remaining time)

C. Output

Generate a unique download link

Display:

Expiry time countdown

Manual delete button

3. File Retention Rules (Hard Constraints)

Files must be automatically deleted when expiry time is reached

Files must not be extendable beyond 24 hours

Expiry reduction is allowed

Expiry extension is forbidden

Deleted files must be unrecoverable

4. Backend Requirements (File Sharing Tab)

Secure file storage (local or object storage)

Unique, non-guessable URLs

Background cleanup job (cron / scheduler)

Validate expiration on every download request

5. Security & Stability

No silent failures

Clear validation messages

File size limits configurable

Safe handling of concurrent uploads

No public file listing

No persistent storage beyond expiry

6. Application Structure

Tab-based UI (Image | File Sharing)

Clean separation of logic

Clear folder structure

Environment-based configuration

7. Deliverables

Fully working web app

Clear README explaining:

Setup

Image conversion flow

File expiration logic

No placeholder logic

No broken animations

Non-Negotiable

GIF animation must never break

File retention must never exceed 24 hours

Duration trimming must only remove frames from the END
